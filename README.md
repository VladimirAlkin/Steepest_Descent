# Steepest_Descent
#My realization of Steepest Descent method. 

#Made for two variable function. 

#To change a function - follow the steps written in main.py

#Also - change the area of a shown graph depending on your minimum

#I think it wouldn't take long to change the func() function to get any function from a user and work with

#I tried to make that appeared graph would be based on you minimum but it wasn't optimized good enough so i decided to leave it manually
